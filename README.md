# CanYouSpotIt-
CanYouSpotIt? is a 2D horror puzzle game where players must observe a flickering dark room and identify changes before time runs out. The game aimed to challenge players' memory, perception, and attention to detail while creating an eerie atmosphere with suspenseful visuals.

While it is unfinished, i learnt a lot while making this project. Further additions that i wanted to do in this game but lacked the skillset or time to do so are:

Multiple levels: the player advancing from one level to another, each with increasing difficulty be it by even dimmer rooms or more objects lost.

More rooms.

More differences other than just hiding of object like colour change, rotation, shape, etc.

More horror elements. Better assets and like sound effects.

UI. Buttons and timers and texts to enhcance the user experience.

A lot of improvements can be made and i am excited for them!!
